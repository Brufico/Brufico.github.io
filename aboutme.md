# subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me
---

Hello,

My name is Bruno Fischer Colonimos.

I am a *Quantitative Analysis* teacher. 

I have done this for a long time now. I have worked in many different settings, most of the time with Business students, but also with Computer Science students. Last year, at **Essec**, the most frequent background in the group was Engineering.  

I have nearly always worked in higher education, in a range of different curricula:
 
* Short 2-years programmes (BTS)
* "Junior" Business Schools (Masters programmes)
* "Full" Business School programs, at the undergraduate level.


Roles
-----

I have been:

* Teacher
* Academic tutor (i.e. professor in charge of a year of study) 
* Dean of studies
* Head of professional education

Today, I concentrate on teaching.


Teaching
--------

### Institutions

I have worked for a wide range of institutions. I now teach almost exclusively at:

* **Ipag Business School**, Paris, France
* **American Business School**, Paris, France
* **Essec**, Cergy, France

### Topics

I regularly teach the following subjects:

* Introductory Mathematics of Finance
* Introductory Statistics
* Management Science.

### Teaching philosophy

At the beginning of my academic life, I have also taught *Sailing* on the side. It has been a seminal experience. It taught *me* some fundamental truths about education:

* **Teaching is a misnomer**. The teacher does not really *teach*. He/she opens doors, provides point-of-views, perspectives and a learning framework to the student. The essential part of the learning process occurs inside the student. The student really *learns*. <br>Educators  really are the *sherpas*, the guides, while the student is both the workforce, the recipient and the product of the educational process.
* **Activity is key**. You learn by doing, by experiencing things. You cannot learn anything without engagement. Therefore, engagement is essential for the teacher as well.
* **Plan the work, but don't necessarily work the plan**. As a teacher, you must prepare a great deal. You have to set objectives, prepare a range of activities, imagine outcomes... But you should never fall in love with your preparation. It is a mean, not an end. <br>Teaching Sailing, meeting with my pupils in the mordning, on the seashore, I had to watch the sky, evaluate the wind, gauge the experience of the group I had, and adapt, even improvise. A good preparation will allow you to do that. Situation is key.<br>Of course, different educational settings spell different constraints for the educator. But such should be the spirit: *Focus on the end, not on the means*.


Education
---------
I have a "Licence" in Mathematics, and a Masters in Management.
I still learn, notably about Data Science.


Interests
---------

I am fascinated by all aspects of human decision-making. Therefore, I am very interested in all kinds of technology that aim to assist decision-making, be it in Data analysis, Decision Analysis / Management Science or in Teaching *per se*.
